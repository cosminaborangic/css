		<p>As with any trip, what you can do will be determined by how much time you have, as well as the time of year. Japan is at its most delightful in spring and autumn, with summers very hot and humid anywhere south of Hokkaidō. I’d recommend avoiding the national holiday periods like Golden Week in early May and Obon in the summertime, when tickets and accommodation are scarce and many attractions close down. If you want to do a lot of things that appeal to Japanese kids (amusement parks, anime or manga attractions, and so on), try to visit outside school holidays.</p>

		<p>Picking the “where” of your trip is entirely up to you and your interests. I usually recommend to friends that they think about a theme. Japan’s 12 remaining original historic castles, say, or temples, shrines and Zen gardens. You might focus on dazzling big-city life, quiet rural trains that wind their way through the mountains or a specific bit of especially charming Japanese popular culture (like Pokémon, Studio Ghibli or Evangelion). </p>

		<p>Most travelers to Japan who want to do more than a simple return from Tokyo to Kyoto will get great value out of the national Japan Rail Pass, specifically designed for travelers. There are three versions of the national pass, which you can use over consecutive days: the seven-day pass costs $226 ($32 per day), the 14-day pass $360 ($26 per day) and the 21-day pass $460 ($22 per day). When you consider that a one-way Shinkansen ticket from Tokyo to Kyoto is more than $100, these passes are a no-brainer for anything beyond a simple round-trip train ticket.</p>

		<p>Though the value of a rail pass increases the more you use it, it will still constitute a big chunk of your travel budget. (I usually estimate that the pass will be about one-third of the cost of my entire trip.) Even as an avid rail fan whose idea of a great time includes whizzing around the country on a Shinkansen at 200 miles (320km) per hour, relaxing on a fancy Limited Express, enjoying the cultural experience of a Joyful Train trip or trundling through the countryside on tiny rural trains, I tend not to want to do more than one week of rail travel at a time without setting down in one place for a few days.</p>

		<p>As a rule, if I’m spending two weeks in Japan, I’ll bracket a seven-day Japan Rail Pass between a few days in Tokyo on either side. If I’m spending three weeks, I might buy two separate seven-day passes, with some time relaxing in a cultural city like Kyoto, Nara or Kanazawa in the middle, or even stick with one rail pass plus a one-way return trip to Tokyo.<p>
